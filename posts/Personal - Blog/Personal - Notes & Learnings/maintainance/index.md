<!-- TEASER_END -->

## List of Wrongdoings
- [ ] Intereseted more on the result than working towards it
- [ ] Paying too much attention to what others are doing 
- [ ] Taking win or loss too much seriously, for winning to become unconscious allow some room for losses too
- [ ] Always being pumped up, inorder to project manliness (instead tell yourself that all are equals and talk to them as you talk with anybody else)
- [ ] More time is spent on planning & very little on its implementation
- [ ] More dreaming & Less work
- [ ] Allowed too much of sexual anxiety to creep in, to an extent where either I end up running away or try to avoid an eye contact. I should rather see them as equals & just similar to me who is leading life.
- [ ] Allowed too much of life to happen in automatic
- [ ] Stopped using filter in thought procession, allowing unimportant, un-necessary  things to occupy the head & eventually filling the cache with crap 
- [ ] Running away in the midst of high time(highly necessary)
- [ ] Unable to moveone from people & issues, events, becoming inefficient by working with unfree mind.
- [ ] Freaking out about not implementing the plan, it would add nothing rather only make the person sick instead consider it as a data point & do not repeat it again. 
- [ ] Whenever automatically irrelevant things pop up in head, I should consider that they happen from the few remains of old me & tell myself not to beat my head too much about it

## Motto
- To make the best use of TIME - efficient, content & just usage
- If I am unable to do what I have decieded to do, how will I ever become who I want to ? 
- Question the Self -  all eminating. all encomapassing 

## Things to be worked upon
- [ ] Develop Speaking Skills, overcome the discontinuity while communicating
- [ ]
