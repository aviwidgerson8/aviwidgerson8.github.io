## 19th April 2021
- Never Ever (not even to a spec of a second), depend emotionally on any other person other than yourself (not even father, mother, noone, there's no compromise to this). 
- Manliness comes from responsibility, facing the situation not running from it, cowards run. Men think.
- Never Ever Cry, there's no reason in this world to cry for, crying meaning not able to consume that something which happens not as we wanted/wished it to happen.
- Be Rationally Sensitive to people, even in emotion don't lose the logic
- Be aware of the means through which you are seeking gratification, If you are not aware, then you are being mindless & prone to addiction
- What we learned from Nidhi's episode, I compromised my self-respect, my self-esteem like a dog, literally dog. YUCK! 

## 7th April 2021
- Confidence comes from achievement -> achievement comes with focus & attention on the objective -> active mind to remind priorities, managing gratifications & sources
- End result is only a destination, it has to be percieved with active mind, perserverence
- Distractions - they come out of past psyche, or come from interia of rest or peace.

## 17th March 2021
- The equations are very simple, man should focus on skills, work, objectives & goals whereas wooing part should be left to women. Happiness found within is of most stable form & anything that comes from outside is only addition to it but bound by uncertainity. You are the Krishna of your destiny & your mind is the Arjuna. Your breadth is your weapon & guiding source.

## 15th March 2021
- Today very confirmingly I realized that most stable form of happiness comes from within & whatever happiness comes from outside will only be an uncertain, unstable addition. Men are supposed to work on themselves & women make their opportunistic choices. There's nothing such as love or friendship or relationships, everything is a disguised exchange.

## 16th February 2021
- Today is my mother's birthday, it is a nice occasion for me to inflect myself onto a more appropriate path. I decide to take control of my attention, mind & body. I will be the regulator of my gratifications & works. I want to win this competition in open, I need to defea people who have been preparing better than me for months, the essential difference would be practice & focus. Attention of the undecided is branched. I'm going to correct my fundamentals, I am living to work, not to sleep, not to eat, nor to do anything else. The fundamental difference b/w an animal & a man is the thought, I can' allow the animal instincts cloud my thoughts.  It will be team work of me, luffy(mind) & zoro(body).

## 3rd February 2021
- At every instant carefully asses the parameters & tune the self that would fulfill the demands of the objectives important  for the moment. I'm feeling afraid implies that I'm not prepared, so to remove the fear, I need to finish the things.

## 23rd January 2021
- I am slowly pulling up myself, I have my luffy with me in heart & soul. It pains when my father, though it was an enquiry, when he asks if I had changed the password. I am working on to stay conscious all of the time untill I remain awake, I'm here to work, to perform my duty & sleep is an aid not an objective in itself. I should spend time judiciously for it & no more swaying with moods, I'm the whole & sole god & demon of my time. I have my luffy, my body & me.

## 21st January 2021
- I got some of my light back. I tried rejig a part of my old plan

---
## 16th January 2021
- I am promising on my mother, today is the end of Nidhi in my life - MOTHER PROMISE.

---
## 7th January 2021
- I have bought all the essentials for my stay & made all arrangements for seemless flow after the start. Also, I wasted some of my time by giving some thought for non-sensical issues but I re-learned that once the weakness know humans cannot stop themselves from exploiting it. So, the re-learned lesson is, "Never ever ever let anybody else know your weakness & Never ever put anybody else above you".

## 5th January 2021
- I can see myself moving away from my father in connection, I don't wish to cater my attention to that aspect, either for good or bad it doesn't anything to my probability of winning. I can sense the aura that I am all alone & I'm on my own. It is my life & I have to win to live. 

## 4th January 2021
- I moved to Hyderabad, for rejuvenation & efficiency

# December'20

## 30th December 2020
- I changed my plan to fit with prevailing situtation, making the preparation more focussed & reduced the alloted time for other activities

---
## 29th December 2020
- I want to clear as many pending tasks as possible before new year starts & from then on I shall stick to my planned routine.

## 23rd - 28th December 2020
***Jyothi's Marriage Break***

---
## 21st December 2020
- I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.
- I reflected on changes I had gone through & assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity & compassion I hold for people in general.

## 20th December 2020
- Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.
