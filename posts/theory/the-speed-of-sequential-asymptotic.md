> Review of Journal of Economics Paper from Omer Tamuz's Group

In brief this paper tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect to signals *external observations* rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by \\(\sqrt{\log t}\\) times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence.

They were also emphasizing on the sublinerity of the actions influence. Sublinearity means \\(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{n}\\).
