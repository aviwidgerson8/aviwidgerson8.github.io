## 8th February
### 1. **Do you think the policy of liberalization has attained its full potential in India? Critically examine.**
 The Policy of Liberalization in India was though being a step in right step taken in the demanding times it wasn't a well planned choice by that time many global chains got well established, including the SA & SEA region which were our complemetaries. The execution was well performed though late by taking careful actions to bring out from then for long looming BOP crisis, this helped sectors which were restricted to the govt. provided to licences to market, slowly the growth rates have started to pickup with investments coming from abroad, India was able to pull out almost 200M from poverty within 20 odd years - the reports says. 
 
 - Currently other than few strategic sectors - Atomic, Defense etc. India has opened up it's economy but still not limiting to the access alone, there exists some operational inefficies when it comes to conducting / establishing a business. In the last few years the govt. has been pro-active in taking steps towards removing the bottle-necks - by fast-tracking the licences issues, court issues, IBC etc., India has moved from this rank to to this rank as per the ding dong index, though the steps taken being in right direction India has been slow in taking them to frution, the products & services are not being competitive enough for the markets to open up completely 
 
### 2. **Do you think disinvestment of public sector units can bring in efficiency and promote competition? Critically comment.**
Rough

- provides room, after liberalization ex: telecom sector
- current budget insisted on disinvistment
- less burden to govt. exchequer & also management, makes it nimble
- consumers will have more choices
- privatization doesn't always gaurentee efficiency
- free's the company from obligations of public procurement & better management
- privatization will have better access to advanced technolgoies
-  #doubt : Which committees have recommended or reported on disinvestments in PSUs ?

## 9th February 2021
### 1. **Infrastructure expansion has significant multiplier effect for the economy. Do you agree? What are the current constraints of infrastructure expansion in India? Discuss.**
Investment in infrastructure can be realized as development in multiple fronts like trade, employement, production, consumption which from the key factors of economy.

-  #doubt : A statistic of British India, how much increase in export of cotton happened with railways ?
-  #doubt : A statistic of how much investment in infra contributes how much of GDP ?
- increases exports with better development of SEZs & enhanced supply chains
- less input costs & latency with better enhanced supply chans 
- less production cost & benefits to consumers, increases in consumption 
- more employment & more equatible distribution
Currently the most dominant problem of Infrastructure is financing, the recent National Infra Pipleline is a true reflection of need & rightly addresses it.
- The existing models of PPP & other models have not been able to garner the private into financing the projects
- The constraints posed from input aspects like - land acquitions, environmental clearances & other human factors etc.
- The factors responsible for Ease of Doing Business
- Cost of Capital
 With latest governemnt interventions like NIP, InviTs, DFI, govt. will be able to mobilize capital & finance the infrastructure development 
 
### 2. **What are Indiaâ€™s recent achievements in the field of green energy? Illustrate.**
India has pledged NDC that 40% of energy demand will be addressed by RNWE by 2030 & 175GW by solar

- India currently has installed capacity of so & so - list some recently inaugarated solar projects , 
- it has planned to establish wind energy plants in TN, KA & Gujarat, Lakswadeep or Andaman
- India has introduced National Hydrogen Fuels Mission, 
- India is constructing LPG city gasline grids which are expected to reduce the net CO2 emissions, 
- India has introduced National Biofuels Mission by blending ethanol with fossil fuels it intends to bring down the fuel imports bills simultaneously, 
- India's integration of RNWE to electricity grid

If India gets the gaspipeline project from Iran to India via pakistan it would also be a great benefit
