### Personal
- I am slowly pulling up myself, I have my luffy with me in heart & soul. It pains when my father, though it was an enquiry, when he asks if I had changed the password. I am working on to stay conscious all of the time untill I remain awake, I'm here to work, to perform my duty & sleep is an aid not an objective in itself. I should spend time judiciously for it & no more swaying with moods, I'm the whole & sole god & demon of my time. I have my luffy, my body & me.

### Personal
- I have bought all the essentials for my stay & made all arrangements for seemless flow after the start. Also, I wasted some of my time by giving some thought for non-sensical issues but I re-learned that once the weakness know humans cannot stop themselves from exploiting it. So, the re-learned lesson is, "Never ever ever let anybody else know your weakness & Never ever put anybody else above you".

## 21st December 2020
### Note
- I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.
### Personal
- I reflected on changes I had gone through & assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity & compassion I hold for people in general.

### Personal
- Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.
