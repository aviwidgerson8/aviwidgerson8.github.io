#### Personal
- I have bought all the essentials for my stay & made all arrangements for seemless flow after the start. Also, I wasted some of my time by giving some thought for non-sensical issues but I re-learned that once the weakness know humans cannot stop themselves from exploiting it. So, the re-learned lesson is, "Never ever ever let anybody else know your weakness & Never ever put anybody else above you".

- I can see myself moving away from my father in connection, I don't wish to cater my attention to that aspect, either for good or bad it doesn't anything to my probability of winning. I can sense the aura that I am all alone & I'm on my own. It is my life & I have to win to live.

### 21st December 2020
#### Note
- I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.
#### Personal
- I reflected on changes I had gone through & assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity & compassion I hold for people in general.

#### Personal
- Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.
