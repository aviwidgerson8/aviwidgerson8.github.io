- [ ] His method of preparing groud for political activism has been adopted by both Gandhi & Ambedkhar
- [ ] To him, swarjya was also linked to swa-bhusha (indigenous language & attire)

## Rebuild India's confidence, revive the economy
- [ ] banks have only transmitted 1.1% of the 2.6% cut to consumer & industry
- [ ] Data shows that just in the month of Jun, 62M people demanded work under the MGNREGA Act programme
- [ ] There is a misplaced sense of apprehension that providing large cash assistance may deter people from returning to the workforce when needed the most.
- [ ] In US nearly 3/4th have recieved higher pay & benefits during the covif19 than what they used to get from their employers
- [ ] The measure taken by RBI & govt. have failed to revive as banks were not confident of lending
- [ ] India cannot be too fiscally restrained in these distressing times

## PM-KISAN is not reaching all farmers as intended
- [ ] PM-KISAM was also included in PM-GKY Packge
- [ ] only 21% of the cultivators interviewed in survey reported of having recieved the benefit. The exclsion is greater in UP > Haryana & Rajasthan
- [ ] not pro-poor population since recipients of PM-KISAN seem to be better off than the general rural population 
- [ ] Problems in identification of beneficiaries in the absence of propoer land records, there's been no particular reason hwy landless labour should be denied the income support scheme 
- [ ] In a survey, the proportion of who had to borrow to meet their day-to day needs during lockdown was low for the farmers(34%) compared to casual wage workers & businesses, while 7% of farm households suffered from unavailability of food this was much higher for casual workers(24%) & businesses(14%)

- [ ] Ryuthu Bandhu Scheme(Farmer Investment Support Scheme) ? (Telangana) - this was first among such farmer investment schemes 
- [ ] KALIA Scheme ? Odisha - not linked to extent of land owned, so will also benefit share croppers 

## Educaiton Policy does not adequately tackle the issue of inequality arising out of medium of instruction
- [ ] Basha Schools have been under great disadvantage over years where the english-medium started in metros has reached to village levels and pushed the bhasha schools to little relevance, people studying this school are handicapped in comparision in many ways 
  - they are extremely poor & recieve very poor quality of education 
  - rarely they are from families with educaitonal background & find it very difficult to compete with their english-speaking counterparts (usually have much better financial background)
- [ ] sutdying in english leads to gaps in understanding one's own society, which is necessary for the survival of the children
- [ ] Providing Special Funds at gram panchayats/ zilla parishad levels for english-teaching could also help 

## The govt. & RBI face a trilemma regarding PSBs
- [ ] In last decade, the overall share of PSBs in lending basket has dropped from 75.1% to 57.5% at present
- [ ] The trilemma lies around
  - Dominance of PSBs in banking sector
  - Independence in Regulation by RBI
  - Adherence to public debt-GDP targets
- [ ] the govt. along with RBI cannot hope to achieve all at the same time, only two are possible at the same time
- [ ] As PSBs keep losing share they will cause fewer headaches for the govt. & RBI in decades to come also unchecked privatization may not be the solution, a balanced approach is needed where resolution process of financial failure of private banks needs to be evolved

## India's Population data & a tale of two projections
- [ ] Which states have highest & least TFR ? 
- [ ] Cairo Conference on Population & Development, 1994 ? the targets of family plannig and forced sterlization were abandoned
- [ ] the stick of policies designed to punish people with large families has been largely ineffective
  - denial of maternity leave for third or subsequent birth, limiting benfits of maternity schemes & inelgibility to contest in local body elections for individuals with large families
- [ ] Being the most populated nation is India's destiny, it should find ways to enhance life of current & future citizens
