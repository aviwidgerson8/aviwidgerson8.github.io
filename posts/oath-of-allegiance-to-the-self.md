I would like to take pledge to my self on this ocassion of new beginning.

- I promise to shed all the unconscious activity which is happening due to my meaningless actions
- I promise to contain my precious drive for justice to the self.
- I promise to commit to the words of Aswatthama which can be found in Karna Parv - `passion, engagement, skill and policy - these are the means to accomplish objectives`.

Finally I would like to conclude with a strong line to myself, `If I am not able to do what I have planned then there's point in living; there's no meaning in being a man`. A warrior should practice a skill with utmost seriousness, discipline & vigour untill he reaches the level of personal satisfaction.

I promise I will live upto your expectations Hasanth.

Yosh.
