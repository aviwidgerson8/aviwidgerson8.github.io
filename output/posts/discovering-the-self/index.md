Exactly 1 year ago I had my mental explosion which I think is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. It's since that day I started to move closer to the self, questioning regarding every second of mylife of then and beyond. I feel I like I have started my search for all the tools that would get me prepared to quench my mental aspirations. I had to never look back again because I had got my lesson cracking all the fairies I have created out of no contemplation;since my 8-10yol self. 

I moved too far from my originality which was the reason I was able to bounce back as if someone had put me into a `cataput` and pulled me far enough to show the threats(dark side of thinking - without conscience) to be aware and released with me with a bag of ammuno into war zone. Here I am today with mental strength which is like a gazillion times mightier than what I had before and this commensurately resembles with my aims too. From today, I would like to resume my daily streak of blogging. As my parents relation turned 25 and I would like to post this photo of theirs as an object of best wishes to self. Yosh

## Welcoming the Best day of my Life
