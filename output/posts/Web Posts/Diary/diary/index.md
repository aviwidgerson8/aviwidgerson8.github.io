### 21st December 2020
#### Work
I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.
#### Personal
I reflected on changes I had gone through & assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity & compassion I hold for people in general.

None
#### Personal
- Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.
