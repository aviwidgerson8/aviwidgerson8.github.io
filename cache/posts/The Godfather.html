<h1>The Godfather</h1>
<p>In the quest of attaining a steel heart and a hard head I have been  looking in for sources like books, movies, video-clips etc. which would make me closer to the objective end, this is when I pulled out the movie which had kept me in waiting to analyse why it is honoured as one of the greatest movies of all time - "The Godfather".</p>
<p>Working on mastering the attention at times I digress and board the old boats which I used to sail before; watching movies for no reason. This was one such scenario I don't know why I had thought of watching a movie. So, as one of those who tries to search for correlations between the characters in the movie to the life of own, I found the a few points which add up for the number of correlation, they are as follows -</p>
<ul>
<li>Family - Never let others know what  all think about as a family in any instant.</li>
<li>Intelligence - A blow to Intelligence is what excites me about the targets.</li>
<li>No Friends - In reality there will be no free friends &amp; relying on the mind is the best of anything.</li>
<li>Composure - The indifference expression on the face is what I would like to carry with me throughout.</li>
</ul>
