<p>I would like to take pledge to my self on this ocassion of new beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>I promise to shed all the unconscious activity which is happening due to my meaningless actions</li>
<li>I promise to contain my precious drive for justice to the self.</li>
<li>I promise to commit to the words of Aswatthama which can be found in Karna Parv - <code>passion, engagement, skill and policy - these are the means to accomplish objectives</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I would like to conclude with a strong line to myself, <code>If I am not able to do what I have planned then there's point in living; there's no meaning in being a man</code>. A warrior should practice a skill with utmost seriousness, discipline &amp; vigour untill he reaches the level of personal satisfaction.</p>
<p>I promise I will live upto your expectations Hasanth.</p>
<p>Yosh.
