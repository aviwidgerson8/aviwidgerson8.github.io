<h2>Northeast's Growth Potential</h2>
<ul>
<li>After partition the region has lost the connectivity links through Kolkata port and Chittagong port</li>
<li>It has countries, best geological hotspots</li>
<li>the reason for lack of industrial development in the region is beacuse of the high transactional costs</li>
<li>ethic diversity of the region must be considerd as prime aspect in formulating policies, as impediments that arise from this also are one of reasons for high transactional costs</li>
<li>with the change in emphasis to 5 from 10 where the evaluation doesn't seem to happen untill 10th</li>
<li>In UNCESCO's first world conference on art &amp; culture education - tells that cultural awareness and expression is one of the 8 key competencies that has to be developed in a child</li>

<h2>J&amp;K One year since revocation of special status</h2>
<ul>
<li>due to lack implementation of the set goals and expenditures, there has been no development in the valley region making the youth vulnerable to the militancies</li>
<li>due to various reasons the state was unable to even fulfill the 10/15% of the relief fund that was granted to the state</li>
<li>with no development the problems would remain perrenial  thus abrogation of Article-370 &amp; 35A had brought various changes galvanizing the atmosphere towards development</li>
</ul>
<h2>Road Ahead for PSBs</h2>
<ul>
<li>The privatization of PSBs seems hypothetical as there is a lot stability that is necessary to be established in all the credit lines and we can also infer from the YES Banks's scenario where no private bank has come forward to purchase the stake </li>
<li>The banks need to be assured that even if some bad loans arise ti wouldn't be haunted, this woudl give the confidence in lending </li>
<li>The govt. doesn't have to stand that depositors money are kept safe, why should the poor taxpayers money be spent on the re-capitalization of banks (ex: NPA, Yes-Bank etc.) so Banks should be run entirely on commercial principles but not making state always responsible for its continuance, also cutting down the stake to 26% is dangerous as it would erode the major shareholders independence with the govt.'s veto</li>
<li>Govt. didn't classify Banking Sector as Strategic Sector </li>
<li>PMC recapitalization hadn't worked well where as Yes Bank's did work out - this also indicates a possibility of when RBI is the boss it works well than not</li>
<li>What are some policy induced failures in Banking Sector ? </li>
<li>No formal Nationalized Bank has failed till date which is one point in favour of Banks Nationalization</li>
<li>Does the insurance cover of the depositors be increased in years to come ? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Pendency of Cases &amp; Virtual Courts</h2>

<li>PILs have these days become Publicity Interest litigations or Peculiar Interest Litigations</li>
<li>Virtual proceedings will not have any effect on pendency of judgements when used a replacement to normal proceedings but if used as supplementary it would be of help as contribution</li>
<li>A study says country's literacy rate increases number of cases filed will increase, in 3 deacades it is expected to have around 15 Crore cases where the Judges capacity necessiated would be 75K whereas only around 20K exists in actual</li>
