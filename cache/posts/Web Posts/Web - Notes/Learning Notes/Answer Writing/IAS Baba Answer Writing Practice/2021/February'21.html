<h3>Do you think the policy of liberalization has attained its full potential in India? Critically examine.</h3>
<p>The Policy of Liberalization in India was though being a step in right step taken in the demanding times it wasn't a well planned choice by that time many global chains got well established, including the SA &amp; SEA region which were our complemetaries. The execution was well performed though late by taking careful actions to bring out from then for long looming BOP crisis, this helped sectors which were restricted to the govt. provided to licences to market, slowly the growth rates have started to pickup with investments coming from abroad, India was able to pull out almost 200M from poverty within 20 odd years - the reports says. Currently other than few strategic sectors - Atomic, Defense etc. India has opened up it's economy but still not limiting to the access alone, there exists some operational inefficies when it comes to conducting / establishing a business. In the last few years the govt. has been pro-active in taking steps towards removing the bottle-necks - by fast-tracking the licences issues, court issues, IBC etc., India has moved from this rank to to this rank as per the ding dong index, though the steps taken being in right direction India has been slow in taking them to frution, the products &amp; services are not being competitive enough for the markets to open up completely </p>
