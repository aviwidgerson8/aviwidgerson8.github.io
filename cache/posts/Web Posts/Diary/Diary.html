<h3>21st December 2020</h3>
<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.</p>
<h4>Personal</h4>
<p>I reflected on changes I had gone through &amp; assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity &amp; compassion I hold for people in general.</p>
