<li>Note: I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Personal</h4>
<ul>
<li>I reflected on changes I had gone through &amp; assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity &amp; compassion I hold for people in general.</li>
