<h1>February'21</h1>

<h2>16th February 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is my mother's birthday, it is a nice occasion for me to inflect myself onto a more appropriate path. I decide to take control of my attention, mind &amp; body. I will be the regulator of my gratifications &amp; works. I want to win this competition in open, I need to defea people who have been preparing better than me for months, the essential difference would be practice &amp; focus. Attention of the undecided is branched. I'm going to correct my fundamentals, I am living to work, not to sleep, not to eat, nor to do anything else. The fundamental difference b/w an animal &amp; a man is the thought, I can' allow the animal instincts cloud my thoughts.  It will be team work of me, luffy(mind) &amp; zoro(body).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3rd February 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>At every instant carefully asses the parameters &amp; tune the self that would fulfill the demands of the objectives important  for the moment. I'm feeling afraid implies that I'm not prepared, so to remove the fear, I need to finish the things.</li>
</ul>
<h1>January'21</h1>
<hr>
<h2>23rd January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am slowly pulling up myself, I have my luffy with me in heart &amp; soul. It pains when my father, though it was an enquiry, when he asks if I had changed the password. I am working on to stay conscious all of the time untill I remain awake, I'm here to work, to perform my duty &amp; sleep is an aid not an objective in itself. I should spend time judiciously for it &amp; no more swaying with moods, I'm the whole &amp; sole god &amp; demon of my time. I have my luffy, my body &amp; me. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I am promising on my mother, today is the end of Nidhi in my life - MOTHER PROMISE.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>7th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have bought all the essentials for my stay &amp; made all arrangements for seemless flow after the start. Also, I wasted some of my time by giving some thought for non-sensical issues but I re-learned that once the weakness know humans cannot stop themselves from exploiting it. So, the re-learned lesson is, "Never ever ever let anybody else know your weakness &amp; Never ever put anybody else above you".</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can see myself moving away from my father in connection, I don't wish to cater my attention to that aspect, either for good or bad it doesn't anything to my probability of winning. I can sense the aura that I am all alone &amp; I'm on my own. It is my life &amp; I have to win to live. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I moved to Hyderabad, for rejuvenation &amp; efficiency</li>

</ul>
<hr>

<h2>23rd - 28th December 2020</h2>
<p><strong><em>Jyothi's Marriage Break</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>21st December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.</li>
<li>I reflected on changes I had gone through &amp; assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity &amp; compassion I hold for people in general.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>20th December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.</li>
</ul>
